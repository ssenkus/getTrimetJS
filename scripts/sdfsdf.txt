(12:52) Steven Senkus: hey Joe, a friend of mine is looking to work as a professional graphic designer.  Do you have any tips on how to get to a pro level?  BTW hilarious that the PF icon was chosen; I like the path going through the hills logo
(12:58) jzhanson: Hey steven, yeah i didn't think it was a bad logo, but definitely had to go in a different direction then they initially asked for. As far as being a designer, is your friend going to school at all? Become really familiar with photoshop, indesign and illustrator is really important, and knowing what each program is designed to do. Attention to detail, understanding the purpose of a project and being able to understand what a non-designer (like a client) is asking for and how to represent their idea, while making it your own. Those are just some off the top of my head kind of things, i don't know if there is something more specific he would want to know 
(12:59) Steven Senkus: is school necessary?  did you go?
(13:03) jzhanson: i did go, but i don't think it's necessary. You do learn a lot, but i actually learned more functional design on the job. Not going to school, it is probably more important to start building a portfolio. Taking on freelance work, or doing some stuff for free even, becomes more important. A lot of places say a degree, but experience can make up for it. Working on a project someone has given you will bring up different challenges that you haven't had to deal with before. Overcoming those is the best way to learn the programs. The more you do, the more tools you have to work with for the next project. 
(13:06) Steven Senkus: so, it's exactly like web dev!  good to know, thanks for the advice!
(13:07) jzhanson: yeah, no problem. Hope it helps
